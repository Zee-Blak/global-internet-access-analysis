# Global Internet Access Analysis (2020)

This project explores global internet usage and broadband adoption using R and the tidyverse ecosystem. The goal is to identify the top countries where satellite-based internet providers have the highest opportunity to expand.

This analysis follows the Google Data Analytics 6‑step approach:  
Ask → Prepare → Process → Analyze → Share → Act

## 📊 Key Insights

### 1. Internet Usage Patterns
Developed regions (North America, Europe, East Asia) have near‑universal adoption.  
These are **low‑opportunity markets** for satellite expansion.

### 2. Regional Differences
South Asia and Sub‑Saharan Africa have the **lowest internet penetration** but the **largest populations**, making them high‑impact regions.

### 3. Broadband Correlation
There is a strong positive correlation between broadband adoption and internet usage.  
Countries with weak broadband but high mobile adoption are **ideal for satellite internet**.

### 4. Top 5 Opportunity Markets
1. **India**  
2. **Nigeria**  
3. **Pakistan**  
4. **Bangladesh**  
5. **Ethiopia or Kenya**
